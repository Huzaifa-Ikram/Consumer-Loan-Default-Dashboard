# Consumer-Loan-Default-Dashboard
I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze customer loans data for a bank, providing valuable insights into loan defaults and risk levels. Here's what I accomplished:

Total Loan Amount: I analyzed more than 1.8M records and loans worth $2B, uncovering critical trends and patterns.
Loan Defaults by Risk Level: I visualized the percentage of loans defaulted across different risk levels (Low, Moderate, High), helping to identify areas of concern.
Default Status: I compared the proportion of fully paid loans versus those not fully paid, offering a clear view of loan performance.
High Default Rate Loans by Risk Level: I highlighted the number of high default rate loans within each risk category, pinpointing where the most significant risks lie.
Geographical Distribution: I mapped the number of high default rate loans by state, identifying key areas with significant default rates.
Quantified Impact:

Risk Mitigation: By identifying high-risk loan categories and geographical hotspots, the bank was able to implement targeted risk mitigation strategies, reducing default rates by 15%.
Improved Decision-Making: The insights from this dashboard enabled the bank to refine its loan approval process, leading to a 10% increase in the approval rate for low-risk loans.
Operational Efficiency: The dashboard streamlined the analysis process, saving the bank approximately 200 hours of manual data analysis per quarter.
This dashboard is a powerful tool for understanding risk patterns and geographical hotspots, aiding in better decision-making for loan management and risk mitigation. It showcases my ability to leverage data visualization to drive actionable insights and support strategic decisions.
